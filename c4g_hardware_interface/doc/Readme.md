# Initial joints positions of master-slave trajectories

This file contains the initial joint positions of the master robot and of the slave robot.

The following table contains the joint positions (expressed in radians) you need to take the two robots to, in order to execute the trajectories contained in the [bagfiles](/cooperating_workcell/c4g_hardware_interface/bagfiles/) folder.

| Robot  | Trajectory | Joint 1 | Joint 2 | Joint 3 | Joint 4 | Joint 5 | Joint 6 |
|--------|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Master | Lift       | -1.5787 |  0.4843 | -1.8520 | -0.0113 | -0.7655 | -1.5625 |
| Master | Place      | -1.5787 |  0.2976 | -1.5420 | -0.0297 | -0.2689 | -1.5420 |
| Slave  | Lift       | -1.5627 |  0.4559 | -1.8941 |  0.0115 | -0.7792 | -1.5789 |
| Slave  | Place      | -1.5627 |  0.2634 | -1.5847 |  0.0295 | -0.2774 | -1.5990 |
